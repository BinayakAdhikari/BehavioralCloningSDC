# Behavioral Cloning Self Driving Car

## Summary

Behavioral cloning is a machine learning technique used to teach self-driving cars to mimic the actions of a human driver. It involves collecting data from a human driver navigating a car through various roads and traffic conditions, and then using that data to train a deep neural network to predict the appropriate steering and acceleration commands given a particular input (e.g., camera image). The resulting model can then be used to control a self-driving car in a similar way to how the human driver did.

## Background
The development of self-driving cars has been motivated by a number of factors, including the potential to reduce traffic accidents, improve transportation efficiency, and provide accessibility to people who are unable to drive due to age, disability, or other reasons.

Behavioral cloning has emerged as a promising approach for developing self-driving cars because it allows the car to learn from the experience of a human driver. By collecting data from a human driver navigating through various roads and traffic conditions, a deep neural network can be trained to predict the appropriate steering and acceleration commands given a particular input (e.g., camera image). This can help to ensure that the self-driving car behaves in a way that is similar to how a human driver would.

One advantage of using behavioral cloning is that it can allow a self-driving car to learn from the experience of a skilled human driver, potentially leading to better performance than if the car were trying to learn on its own. However, it can also be challenging to collect high-quality data and ensure that the resulting model generalizes well to new situations. In addition, behavioral cloning does not explicitly take into account the rules of the road or the intentions of other drivers, so the self-driving car may need to be equipped with additional sensors and algorithms to handle these aspects of driving.
It can potentially be used to solve the problem of developing a self-driving car that can navigate roads and traffic conditions in a way that is similar to how a human driver would.

Using behavioral cloning to develop a self-driving car can help to reduce the need for human drivers, potentially addressing issues such as traffic congestion, accidents, and accessibility. However, it is important to note that self-driving cars developed using behavioral cloning may still need to be equipped with additional sensors and algorithms to handle the full range of driving situations and to comply with traffic laws.

## How it is used ?

To use behavioral cloning to develop a self-driving car, the following steps can be followed:

Collect data: Data is collected from a human driver navigating a car through various roads and traffic conditions. This data can include the input (e.g., camera images), as well as the corresponding steering and acceleration commands.

Preprocess data: The collected data may need to be preprocessed in order to remove any noise or inconsistencies. This can involve techniques such as cropping, resizing, or normalizing the input data.

Train a model: A deep neural network is trained on the collected and preprocessed data to predict the appropriate steering and acceleration commands given a particular input.

Evaluate the model: The trained model is evaluated on a hold-out dataset to determine its performance. If the performance is not satisfactory, the model may need to be refined by collecting additional data or adjusting the model architecture.

Deploy the model: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a self-driving car to control its steering and acceleration.

It is important to note that self-driving cars developed using behavioral cloning may still need to be equipped with additional sensors and algorithms to handle the full range of driving situations and to comply with traffic laws.


## Data sources and AI methods

To use behavioral cloning to develop a self-driving car, data is collected from a human driver navigating a car through various roads in the unity simulator. This data includes input from three cameras in the simulated car, as well as the corresponding steering and acceleration commands.

The collected data is typically preprocessed in order to remove any noise or inconsistencies. This can involve techniques such as cropping, resizing, or normalizing the input data.

To train a model using behavioral cloning, a deep neural network is typically used. The neural network is trained on the collected and preprocessed data to predict the appropriate steering and acceleration commands given a particular input. This can be done using supervised learning, in which the network is provided with both the input data and the corresponding labels (i.e., the steering and acceleration commands).

Other AI methods that may be used in conjunction with behavioral cloning include unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning. These methods can be used to improve the performance of the model or to adapt the model to new situations.

## Challenges

There are several challenges associated with using behavioral cloning to develop self-driving cars, including:

Data quality: It is important to collect high-quality data in order to train a model that performs well. This can be challenging, as the data must accurately represent the various roads and traffic conditions that the self-driving car will encounter.

Generalization: The model trained using behavioral cloning must be able to generalize to new situations that it has not seen before. This can be challenging, as the model is only exposed to a limited set of data during training.

Handling edge cases: Behavioral cloning does not explicitly take into account the rules of the road or the intentions of other drivers. As a result, the self-driving car may need to be equipped with additional sensors and algorithms to handle these aspects of driving.

Ethical considerations: Self-driving cars have the potential to displace jobs in the transportation sector and raise ethical questions about the allocation of responsibility in the event of an accident.

Legal and regulatory issues: There are a number of legal and regulatory issues that need to be addressed in order to deploy self-driving cars on public roads. These issues can vary by country and may require the development of new laws and regulations.

## What next ?

It is difficult to predict exactly what the future will hold for self-driving cars and behavioral cloning. However, it is likely that both will continue to evolve and be refined over time.

One potential development is the wider adoption of self-driving cars, which could lead to significant changes in the transportation industry. This could have a range of impacts, including on employment, the environment, and urban planning.

Another potential development is the further integration of self-driving cars with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks. This could enable self-driving cars to communicate with each other and with traffic infrastructure in real-time, potentially improving safety and efficiency.

It is also possible that new approaches to developing self-driving cars will emerge, such as hybrid systems that combine behavioral cloning with other machine learning techniques.
